*	I will run, I will climb, I will soar
*	I'm undefeated.. oo
*	Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
*	Yeah I believe it
*	The past, is everything we were
*	don't make us who we are
*	So I'll dream, until I make it real
*	and all I see is stars
*	It's not until you fall that you fly
*	When your dreams come
*	alive you're unstoppable
*	Take a shot, chase the
*	sun, find the beautiful
*	We will glow in the dark
*	turning dust to gold
*	And we'll dream..
*	It possible
*	Possible
*	And we'll dream..
*	It possible
*	I will chase, I will reach, I will fly
*	Until I'm Breaking, Until I'm Breaking
*	Out of my cage, like a bird in the night
*	I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing
*	In, into something big,
*	better than before
*	And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
*	then it's worth fighting for

*	It's not until you fall that you fly
*	When your dreams come
*	alive you're unstoppable
*	Take a shot, chase the
*	sun, find the beautiful
*	We will glow in the dark
*	turning dust to gold
*	And we'll dream..
*	It possible
*	Possible
*	From the bottom to the top
*	We're sparking wild fire's
*	Never quit and never stop
*	The rest of our lives
*	From the bottom to the top
*	We're sparking wild fire's
*	Never quit and never stop
*	It's not until you fall that you fly
*	When your dreams come
*	alive you're unstoppable
*	Take a shot, chase the
*	sun, find the beautiful
*	We will glow in the dark
*	turning dust to gold
*	And we'll dream..
*	It possible
*	Possible
*	And we'll dream..
*	It possible
